### Snake

The snake game in this depository is a very simple game created using the PyGame library. 
Gameplay: you need a keyboard with arrow keys to play. 

### Graphics

The graphics replicate the original snake as best I can. All the images in my game were created by me using a pixel art website [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com).
