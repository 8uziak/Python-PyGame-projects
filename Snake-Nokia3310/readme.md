### UPDATE [09.03.2022]

In this update I focused 100% on OOP (classes, __name__ == "__main__") and improving code readability.

### Snake

The snake game in this depository is the 2nd version of snake [link](https://github.com/8uziak/Python-PyGame-projects/tree/main/Snake-old-Nokia-version). I tried to replicate as best as I can the game for nokia phones from the early 2000s. 

### Graphics

The graphics replicate the original snake as best I can. All the images in my game were created by me using a pixel art website [pixilart](https://www.pixilart.com).

### Sound

I found the sound of a snake eating an apple on a website that has a free sound library [freesound](https://freesound.org).
